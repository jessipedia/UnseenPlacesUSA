# UnseenPlacesUSA

UnseenPlacesUSA is a data research project that explores unknown or ignored places in the United States. This can include places such as iron mines, radar stations, and prisons. The dataset is not meant to be a complete accounting of these locations, but an ongoing exploration of what it means to be seen and unseen, to see and un-see, why places are unseen, and how technology affects our ability to see.

This project currently includes a [web explorer](unseenplaces.us/explorer) for the data, a REST API, and a [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/UnseenPlacesUSA).

This is an ongoing project.

##Public

Contains public files for the web explorer, api, and visual tests.

##Tools

Contains webscrapers and associated files for generating the dataset.
